# SVAR
```
# SVAR is a simple standard for formatting data. It supports integers, strings and booleans. You do not need to quote anything. Each value is seperated like this:
value name:value
# Here is what a boolean looks like:
bool name:true
# Here is what a integer looks like:
int name:123
# Here is what a string looks like:
string name:This is a string.
# As you can see above, you can put spaces in the name of a value.
This is the name of a value:1
# The only restricted character is the newline character.
You can even use colons: during a string : just not in the title.
# The Python interpreter is very fast and only 37 lines!
```
There is a Python interpreter included, feel free to put a PR for a interpreter for another language.
